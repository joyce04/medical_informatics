Aim: 

- On the other hand, the availability of novel data streams for disease detection can help in overcoming these issues by capturing an additional surveillance signal that can be used to complement data collected by public health agencies.
- Combining both traditional and participatory Web-based surveillance data can provide accurate predictions for seasonal influenza in real-time fashion.
- traditional surveillance data based on sentinel doctors reports and digital surveillance data deriving from a participatory system that monitors the influenza activity through Internet-based surveys.

Model : 

- a linear autoregressive exogenous (ARX) model based on traditional surveillance data.
- one advantage of the participatory system Influweb is that data are available in real-time, not just for the previous week as for Influnet. Thus, we used a forecasting model that integrates the real-time ILI signal detected by Influweb into the epidemiological signal of Influnet.
  First, we produced ILI predictions by including the previous three weeks of ILI incidence reported by Influnet and the Influweb signal for the current week in a linear autoregressive exogenous (ARX) model, as described in [34].



Data Collection :

- Influnet - national surveillance system for influenza syndromes in Italy
- Influweb - web-based participatory surveillance system

Result : 
- Our results show that by using data extracted from a Web-based participatory surveillance system, which are usually available one week in advance with respect to traditional surveillance, it is possible to obtain accurate weekly predictions of influenza activity at national level up to four weeks in advance.
