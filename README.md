1. mimic
   Data exploration with MIMIC-III
   MIMIC-III : openly available dataset developed by the MIT Lab for Computational Physiology, MIT Lab for Computational Physiology, containing data for 61, 532 ICU stays for 46, 520 patients. In addition to structured clinical data (demographics, vital signs, laboratory tests, medications, etc.), it contains over 2 million free-text notes from nurses, physicians, specialists, and more.
